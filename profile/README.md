# CryptoCasino

We decided to build CryptoCasino after witnessing the frustrations and challenges faced by new users in the web3 and online gaming ecosystems. The users have particularly distressing experience with the traditional online gambling platforms for example the most famous game known as "COLOR GAME" that promised false/fake RNG (Random Number Generator), Zero transparency, Centralized Control and also imposed hidden restrictions on withdrawal and unfair terms. This experience highlighted the need for a transparent, fair, and user-centric gaming platform. Inspired by the Chainlink potential of true VRF, CCIP, Automation, Data Feeds, Functions and decentralized finance (DeFi), AI, GameFi we set out to create CryptoCasino a platform that combines the best of gaming, AI, and blockchain to provide a safe, enjoyable, and transparent gaming experience. Our goal is to empower users with true ownership of their assets, fair gameplay, and a secure environment free from exploitative practices.

CryptoCasino is a comprehensive gaming hub where multiple gambling games can be played by users, seamlessly integrating gaming, decentralized finance (DeFi), cross-chain functionality, gaming finance, and artificial intelligence to deliver a superior user experience. Users can create AI-generated NFT profile pictures based on their chosen keywords and explore other players' profiles. The platform currently features a proof of concept (MVP) of one game, a fully functional roulette game, allowing users to place various types of bets. Powered by Chainlink VRF, the roulette wheel ensures fair and verifiable randomness, while Chainlink Automation calculates and transfers winnings to users' wallets automatically. CryptoCasino also offers a robust lending service where users can deposit tokens from any supported chain as collateral to borrow LINK, facilitating seamless gameplay without the need to liquidate their holdings. Real-time asset prices provided by Chainlink Data Feeds ensure accurate and transparent collateral management, enhancing the overall gaming and financial experience.

## How We Built It

Building CryptoCasino involved the integration of multiple blockchains to ensure a robust, transparent, and user-friendly platform. We started by utilizing Chainlink Functions to mint AI-generated NFT profile pictures on the Avalanche network, leveraging DALL-E3 to create unique images based on user inputs.

The core gaming logic, specifically for the roulette game, was developed and deployed on the Polygon network. This choice was driven by Polygon's fast transaction speeds and low fees, which are critical for a smooth gaming experience. For randomness in the roulette game, we integrated Chainlink VRF to guarantee fair and verifiable outcomes. Chainlink Automation was employed to handle game operations, such as spinning the roulette wheel, calculating winnings, and transferring funds to users' wallets automatically.

We implemented a lending service that allows users to deposit tokens from any supported chain as collateral to borrow LINK. Chainlink Data Feeds were used to fetch real-time asset prices, ensuring accurate and transparent collateral management. Cross-chain compatibility was achieved through Chainlink CCIP, facilitating seamless asset transfers and communication across different blockchain networks. The lending contracts were deployed on Avalanche Fuji C-Chain, taking advantage of its secure and scalable infrastructure.
